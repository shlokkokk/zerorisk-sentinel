# Cyberthon – ZeroRisk Sentinel

https://cyberthon-zeta.vercel.app/

ZeroRisk Sentinel is an academic cybersecurity project developed for a college Cyberthon demonstration.  
The project focuses on early-stage risk awareness by statically analyzing files, URLs, and mobile applications without executing them.

## Overview
Modern digital threats often overlap across files, links, and applications.  
ZeroRisk Sentinel explores a unified approach to observing these risks within a single system, prioritizing understanding and interpretation over active blocking.

The project is designed strictly for learning, demonstration, and concept validation.

## Key Features
- Static file analysis using basic indicators
- URL analysis based on common phishing characteristics
- Mobile application (APK) metadata and permission observation
- Clear, human-readable risk explanations
- Demo-oriented workflow suitable for academic evaluation

## Analysis Modes
- **Standard Scan**  
  Performs basic rule-based checks to identify early warning signs.

- **Deep Scan (Demo Mode)**  
  An extended demonstration mode that applies additional indicators and analysis logic for presentation and learning purposes.

## System Components
- File analysis module
- URL analysis module
- Mobile application analysis module
- Explanation layer for simplified output
- Backend services hosted separately for demo use

## Deployment
- Frontend: Hosted for demonstration purposes
- Backend: Hosted on Render (demo environment)

## Project Status
This project is a functional academic prototype created for a college cyberthon.  
Some components and modes are intentionally simplified to emphasize concepts rather than production-grade security.

## Purpose
- To understand core cybersecurity analysis concepts
- To study static indicators of common digital threats
- To demonstrate unified risk observation in an academic setting
